## kyma install

Installs Kyma on a running Kubernetes cluster

### Synopsis

Installs Kyma on a running Kubernetes cluster.

### Prerequisites

Before you use the command, make sure your setup meets the following prerequisites:

* Kyma is not installed.
* Kubernetes cluster is available with your KUBECONFIG already pointing to it.
* Helm binary is available (optional).

### Installation flow 

The standard installation uses the minimal configuration. The system performs the following steps:

1. Fetches the "tiller.yaml" file from the "/installation/resources" directory and deploys it to the cluster.
2. Deploys and configures the Kyma Installer. At this point, the steps differ depending on the installation type.
    When you install Kyma locally from release, the system:

    1. Fetches the latest or specified release along with configuration.
    2. Deploys the Kyma Installer on the cluster.
    3. Applies downloaded or defined configuration.
    4. Applies overrides if applicable.
    5. Sets the admin password.
    6. Patches the Minikube IP.
3. Configures Helm. If installed, Helm is automatically configured using certificates from Tiller. This step is optional.
4. Runs Kyma installation until the "installed" status confirms the successful installation.
> **NOTE**: You can override the standard installation settings using the "--override" or "--config" flag.
